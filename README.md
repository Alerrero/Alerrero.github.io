# lobo-larsen-web

This is a repo of Lobo Larsen's webpage.

Right now is mainly HTML and CSS and some JS for frontend purposes.
Some features are:
-  Custom Mouse with img
-  Full page nav menu
-  Window inside window design
-  Fully responsive

Next steps i want to take is re-do it with react and add some interactions with custom databases (concerts, music)
